## Features

`ytui` offers a wide range of features designed to enhance
your YouTube experience directly from the terminal. Some of the key features include:

- **YouTube Search and Playback**: Search YouTube videos using keywords
  or retrieve videos from your history or subscribed channels,
  and play them directly in your local terminal video player.

- **FZF Integration**: `ytui` features something similar the popular fuzzy finder
  `fzf` (powered by <https://github.com/ktr0731/go-fuzzyfinder>) to allow fast
  and efficient video search results navigation.
  This makes it easy to browse through large lists of videos
  and pick the one you want to play.

- **Video History Management**: Keep track of the videos you've watched using `ytui`.
  The tool logs your watch history in the `watched_history.json`
  file for quick reference later.

- **Channel Subscription Support**: Search for videos from
  your subscribed YouTube channels or specify channels in the configuration file.

- **OAuth Authentication**: Securely authenticate with YouTube
  using OAuth to access your personal subscriptions.
  The tool leverages the YouTube Data API to fetch data related to your account.

- **Terminal-Based User-interface**: Allowing you to search for videos
  directly from the terminal environment.

- **Customization**: Adjust settings through a configuration file
  located in `$HOME/.config/ytui/config.yaml` to tailor the tool
  to your preferences, such as channel subscriptions and OAuth credentials.

with YouTube directly from your terminal, streamlining video searching
and viewing for command-line users.

## Usage

See [Documentations](docs/ytui.md).

## Configuration

The configuration file for `ytui` is located at `$HOME/.config/ytui/config.yaml`.
This file allows you to specify which channels to subscribe to and your OAuth credentials.

### Configuration File Structure

```yaml
channels:
  local: false
  subscribed:
    - UCTt2AnK--mnRmICnf-CCcrw
    - UCutXfzLC5wrV3SInT_tdY0w
download_dir: ~/Videos/YouTube
history:
  enable: true
invidious:
  proxy: ''
  instance: invidious.jing.rocks
loglevel: info
youtube:
  clientid: fsdfsdf
  secretid: ffsdfsdf
```

#### Notes

- **`local: false`** - When set to `true`, `ytui` will use the channels
  specified in the configuration file for subscribed channels.
  If you prefer to use your Youtube user-subscribed channels, set this to `false`.

- **`channels.subscribed: []`** is a list of channel Ids. To be used with `local: true`.

- **OAuth** - You need to enable OAuth authentication with YouTube
  to access your subscribed channels.
  Ensure that your `clientid` and `secretid` are properly configured.

  The following scope is also required: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly`

- **`invidious.proxy:`** - Must be set with either `socks5://<socks5_proxy>:1234` or `http://<http_proxy>:4567`. Leave empty to disable.

## Files

- **`watched_history.json`** - This file, located in `$HOME/.config/ytui/`,
  logs each video watched using `ytui` when querying the history.

## Examples

1. **Search for a Video on YouTube:**

   ```sh
   ytui query search "your search query"
   ```

1. **Fetch Videos from Your Subscribed Channels:**

   ```sh
   ytui query subscribed
   ```
