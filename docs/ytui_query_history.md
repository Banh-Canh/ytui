## ytui query history

Search for videos from your history

### Synopsis


Search for videos from your history. Due to Youtube Data APIv3 not allowing to retrieve user history,
ytui will feed and store its own history in a json file in the configuration directory. Any video watched with ytui
will be stored in there.

```
